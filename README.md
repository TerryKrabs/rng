### RNG Random Number Generator

### Summary - Today I primarily used bootstrap classes and inline styling, so I could recreate the RNG ptototype. The front end of thsi assignment was a bit confiusing for the first 30 minutes, but once I found my groove things got alot easier. The front end ended up turning out really well, however the back end for this assignment was no joke!!! I managed to get the RN generator working slightly, but it's severely lacking in functionality. I will definitely be trying to perfect this assignment on my free time!
